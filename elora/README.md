# SplitKb Elora

## Base layer modifiers

I could never get used to home-row modifiers used by other layouts such as Miryoku, etc. I was previously using one-shot modifier based on the layout created by Callum, but have recently been experimenting with combo-mods instead. These provide the same benefits as home-row modifiers, but with a significantly reduced risk of accidental activation. The limitation is that you can only fit 3 combos using the 4 home-row keys, but this is not an issue as I keep a dedicated "shift" key anyway.
